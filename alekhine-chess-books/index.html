Alekhine wrote more than 20 books on chess, and two of them are regularly mentioned among the best chess books of all time. Among the oldest and most prized books in my collection is levenfish &amp; romanovsky’s survey of the 1927 world championship match between josé raúl capablanca and alexander alekhine. Alekhine versus morphy 17 4. The fourth title in the popular world chess champion series is about the enigmatic alexander alekhine. The fourth world champion alexander alekhine went down in history not only as a winner of many tournaments and matches and the creator of hundreds of masterpieces of chess creativity.</p>
