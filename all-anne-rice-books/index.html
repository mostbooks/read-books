<h3 id="pin-by-karen-kohl-on-authors-vampire-books-anne-rice">Pin by Karen Kohl on authors Vampire books, Anne rice</h3><p>Rice considered herself an atheist for many years, but returned to catholicism in 1998. The counters while making the list comprises of book ratting, reviews, views, author popularity and many more. Anne rice, born in new orleans in 1941, was best known for her vampire chronicles novels, some of the bestselling novels of all time. Rice went on to write two historical novels titled the feast of all saints and cry to heaven. I liked the relationship between david and lestat, and there seemed to be an actual plot, and not a lot of whining. For though they were descended from african slaves, they were also descended from the french and spanish who enslaved them.</p>
