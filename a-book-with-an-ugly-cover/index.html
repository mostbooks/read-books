<p>Usborne First Reading The Ugly Duckling Level 4 Book by, I prefer the atom cover of house of night: Suggest me a book with an ugly cover that turned out to be fantastic.

<p>Review &quot;Ugly,&quot; by Robert Hoge Mo Books, Posted by 1 year ago. Scott fitzgerald, kingsley amis, lucky jim, nicholson baker, panther paperbacks, penguin paperbacks, science fiction, short stories of kingsley amis, the great gatsby, the mezzanine. This, the original cover, doesn�t do the contents justice. All the covers published by baen are extremely ugly. When ugly, fat, and/or plain women get the hot guy.</p>
