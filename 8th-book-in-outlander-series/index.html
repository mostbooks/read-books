</center> <p><strong>8Th Book In Outlander Series</strong>, The 8th book in the outlander series made its debut as number one on the new york times bestseller list. So here we are in the midst of season one of the starz tv series hiatus and about 5 months post the 8th book in the outlander series, written in my own heart’s blood (moby) being released. While the first book is just about 600 pages long (640 pages in hardcover, to be exact), the remainder of the novels are much longer in length.</p>

Gabaldon’s literary agent, russell galen, said he waited more than a year to negotiate her new contract so that he could leverage the increased interest from the tv show.</p>
<h3 id="my-outlander-purgatory-official-american-release-date-for">My OUTLANDER Purgatory OFFICIAL American Release Date for</h3><p>The american publisher thought it sounded a little too much like embroidery. I have been waiting to read this book since right after the last one came out 4,5 years ago. Am on my 5th reading of the book series ( thank god i am retired so i have the time to devote to outlander 24/7 !) my son gave me the 8th in the series for christmas ! While the first book is just about 600 pages long (640 pages in hardcover, to be exact), the remainder of the novels are much longer in length. And then this summer, the outlander tv.
