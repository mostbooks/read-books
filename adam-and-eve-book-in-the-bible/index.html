<h3 id="adam-and-eve-kregel">Adam and Eve Kregel</h3><p>He told adam to name all the different kinds of animals. This is how jehovah god made adam. Their creation is the focus of chapter 2 with their fall and punishment in chapter 3. Because all men are the descendants of adam and eve, all have inherited a sinful nature from them.
