Access your digital membership card, book flight rewards, view your elite status and transactions, explore offers, and more.</p>

And yes, you can definitely use your expedia account to book. The credit card holder does not need to be a passenger to book flights at qantas.com. As others have mentioned, you can. The only time you can�t is if you�re a super elite and want to use instant kk to book someone else an international j ticket without booking the same reward ticket for yourself as well.
