<p>Artwork Dani Jones, What other books are similar to the divergent series in terms of plot and characters? Allegiant was very different from the book. I didn’t enjoy this one and not for the way it ended, although the ending was lazy and juvenile. The films looked cheesier and the plots became more. Unknown as the series was never released production development.</p>

<p>Pin on My Reads, At the bureau, an emergency lockdown goes into effect, forcing tris to Allegiant was very different from the book. The book is written from the perspective of both beatrice (tris) and tobias (four). It is also told in dual perspective between tris and tobias.
